Malfunction # - Actions - Issues

Malfunction #1:
If Cleaning folder is available:
Actions:
1. See what 05 envs have in them.
2. When ready for new run: 
2.1. Clean: 
2.1.1: Create suitable folder in Channellog_preparation
2.1.2: Move all envs labeled 05 in the folder from 2.1.1.
2.2. Repopulate:
2.2.1: Load "CHANNELLOG33" from the ChannelLog_preparation folder.
2.2.2: Change main folder to SOF and run "edit_ChannelLog.m". This creates a new CHANNELLOG file.
2.2.3: Repopulate the suitable files inside the "Cleaning" folder:
2.2.3.1: Copy all files from PULL_ECG_EMG to PUSH_ECG_EMG
2.2.3.2: Filter out all ECG files.
3. Run S02.

Issues:
P1:
I don't hope mkdir in S02, in the last segment, just writes on existing folders, deleting them.
Otherwise, two options: 
(1) Update CHANNELLOG with proper cleaningAttempts values and re-run.
(2) Start everything again, since data is allegedly copied and recopied [Although since I am not writing new cleaningAttempts values, it shouldn't]..
We should probably check the whole process from the start...

P2:
Data folder in SOF may be very big. I don't know. 
This can also be a problem live, although in live, I would recommend SQL.
However, I am tracking it:
Measuring data-size in SOF:

Date		Hour		Size		Step in process
01-10-20		04:25AM		23.3GB		Before S02
01-10-20		05:02AM		25.8GB		Fault at S02 - Did not filter out ECG files (step 2.2.3.2)


Malfunction #2:
If Cleaning folder is not available:
Actions:
1. I need to go back to S01, last code segment, and try and make it run using the latest environment.
2. I need to make sure all paths are correct. This should be okay if we use the scripts in the "Rerunning_Scripts" folder.
